## Data Streams
### Reading Data Interactively
* Use **input function** to prpmpt the user for a certain value which can be used in a script.

### Standard Streams
* **I/O streams** are the basic mechanism for performing input and output operations in your programs.
* Most operating systems supply three different I/O streams by default each with a different purpose which aren't restricted to just Python.
  * STDIN - the standard input stream which is a channel between a program and a source of input.
  * STDOUT - the standard output stream which is a pathway between a program and a target of output.
  * SDTERR - the standard error stream which displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program.
