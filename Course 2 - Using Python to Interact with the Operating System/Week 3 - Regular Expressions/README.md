# Using Python to Interact with the Operating System - Week 3 - Regular Expressions

## Regular Expressions
### What is regualr expressions?
* A regular expression, also known as regex or regexp, is essentially a search query for text that's expressed by *string pattern*. 
* It allows for searching a text for strings matching a specific pattern.
* When a particular piece of text searched using regex, anything that matches a regular expression pattern you specified, is returned as a result of the search. 

### Why use regular expressions?
* Regex allows for flexibility in string searching and avoids using brittle solution such as index function.

### Basic Matching with grep
* Grep grep works by printing out any line that matches the passed query.
* grep __case sensitive__ example to search for "thon":-
  * ```bash
    grep thon /usr/share/dict/words
    ```
* grep __case insensitive__ example to search for "thon":
  * ```bash
    grep -i thon /usr/share/dict/words
    ```
* Reserved characters to process an irregular expressions in regex:-
  * ".", dot, matches any character which means that it can be used as a wildcard that can be replaced by any other character in the results.
  * "^", caret or circumflex, indicates the beginning of the line. 
  * "$", dollar, indicates the end of the line.
* grep . example to search for a string mathching with "l.rts":
  * ```bash
    grep l.rts /usr/share/dict/words
    ```
* grep cafrat example to search for a string starting with "fruit":
  * ```bash
    grep ^fruit /usr/share/dict/words
    ```
* grep $ example to search for a string ending wiht "cat":
  * ```bash
    grep cat$ /usr/share/dict/words
    ```
