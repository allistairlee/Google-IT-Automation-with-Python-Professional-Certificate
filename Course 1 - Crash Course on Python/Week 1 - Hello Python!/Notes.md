## Introduction to Programming
### What is programming?
* At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do. When you write a program, you create a step by step recipe of what needs to be done to complete a task and when your computer executes the program it reads what you wrote and follows your instructions to the letter.
* Programming languages are actually similar to humans spoken languages since they have a syntax and semantics.
  * In **human language**, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed while semantics refers to the actual meaning of the statements.  
  * In **programming language**, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written and the semantics is the effects the instructions have.  
* What's the difference between a script and a program? Scripts are programs with a short development cycle that can be created and deployed rapidly. In other words, a script is a program that is short, simple, and can be written very quickly.

### What is automation?
* Automation is the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.
* The benefits of autmation includes:-
  * Allowing people to concentrate on more complex, creative, or difficult tasks.
  * Consistency.
  * Helps avoid the possibility of human errors.
  * Reduces the time it takes to do perform tasks.
* For all of its advantages automation isn't a solution for every situation, some tasks just aren't suited for automation. For example, haircut.
* Tasks performed by a computer that need to be done multiple times with little variation are really well suited for automation.

## Introduction To Python
### What is Python?
* Python is a general purpose scripting language.
* Benefits of using Python includes programming in Python usually feels similar to using a human language.
* In programming, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes code. The Python interpreter is the program that reads what is in the recipe and translates it into instructions for your computer to follow.

## Hello World
### Hello, World!
* Functions in Python are pieces of code that performs a unit of work.
* There are keywords in Python are reserved words that are used to construct instruction, such as print.
* ```Python
  print ("Hello, world!")
  ```
  * The print function in Python outputs messages to the screen.
  * The print function wraps text in quotation marks indicates that the text is considered a string, which means it's text that will be manipulated by our script.
  
### Getting information from the user
* Data can be provided to a computer in a bunch of different ways.
  * ```Python
    name = "Brook"
      print ("Hello, " + name)
    ```

### Python can be your calculator too
* Using Python to calculate complex equations.  
  * ```Python
    print ((((1+2)*3)/4)**5)
    ```
